#Result:expected profit from a simulation is not equal to the profit from
#the scenario where each input assumes its expected value
#The reason is that when we consider the expected value of unit price, we can
#not simply avg ($8+$10)/2 to $9, because the sales for two situations are not the same
#by considering the sales, the truly expected unit price should be:
#fixed_price = (0.5*60000*$10+0.5*100000*$8)/(0.5*60000+0.5*100000) = $8.75
#then we can calculate the truly expected profit: fixed_expect_profit = 70000,
